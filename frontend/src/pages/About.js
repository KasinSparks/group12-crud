            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <a className="aboutText">Homeownership is fundamentally an exquisite part of the American Dream. In the past ten years, an average of 5.85 million homes have been sold per year (Statista). As home prices continue to increase (Hermann), it is becoming increasingly ordinary and necessary for new home buyers to research potential houses extensively. Typical house searching applications, such as Zillow (Zillow), provide home seekers with a narrow set of information about the house's details. The majority of the details are static; for example, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, etc. Moreover, the only trend data provided to the user on Zillow are price change history and public tax history. Our application, Connecticut Real estate Unified Database (CRUD), is going to solve this issue by introducing detailed and complex trend analysis that can be performed by the user. </a>
